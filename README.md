Todo:
 * when price is entered, price labels should be recalculated in real-time
 * drop-downs should be pre-populated with different data, depending on what is selected
 * load view with model and populate template with model data
 * load model using GET `localhost/api/listing/draft/:id`
     - may need local server for that (can be done with node and express in 5mins or Nancy for .NET)
 * after editing is done do PUT to `/api/listing/draft/:id`
